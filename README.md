# Draft of Protect Origin Licenses

Meant for meaningful competition, improvement, easier discovery and protecting the original version.

Inspired by various free and non-free software licenses such as Apache License, Eclipse Public License, Mozilla Public License, Artistic License 2.0 and BSD.

Meant not only for software, hm.

Licensed under that same draft license? :D
